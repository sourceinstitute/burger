    Burger Night</h2>
    <p>Burger Night is a place for tech founders to hang out.  No talks, no investors, no business cards. Just us, catching up, keeping it real.
    <p><i class="fa fa-2x fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Burger Night happens every month, at a nice burger joint, usually a cheap one. (Burger Night is boostrapping-friendly.)
    <p><i class="fa fa-2x fa-comment" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    If there is a Burger Night in your city, you have to ask around to find it. Some tech founders will know. Right now, there's a Burger Night in <b>Rotterdam</b> and <b>Sofia</b>. (It started in London, then, well, wtf London?)
    <p><i class="fa fa-2x fa-map" aria-hidden="true"></i> If there's no Burger Night in your city, you can start one if you're a founder and you follow the rules below. Just <a href="mailto:salim@source.institute">let us know</a> so we let everyone know it exists here. 
    <p><i class="fa fa-2x fa-bullhorn" aria-hidden="true"></i> Burger Night isn't advertised anywhere.  It's not listed on any meetup site.  It has no email list or LinkedIn group. It never has a sponsor. (We buy our own dinner, thank you.) It's self-organised so it can't be owned or branded by a PR or events company. We keep it under the radar of all the hype, consultants, politicians and other crap that gets in the way of running a tech business. It's our space.
    <p><i class="fa fa-2x fa-pied-piper" aria-hidden="true"></i> We keep it that way by keeping it to founders only. We welcome all kinds of tech founders, but let's keep it to founders only please.
